# Sonic Streaming: Recreating the Artist Dashboard

Our inspiration toward creating this project began with a shared passion for music, an art form we believe to be one of the most powerful and unifying experiences in our culture. Music not only entertains but also connects us, reflecting our emotions and stories. Despite its impact, we recognized significant limitations in the way music is shared and consumed. The spotlight often shines on just a few prominent artists within each genre, overshadowing countless talented musicians who might offer equally powerful music. Moreover, discussions around music often get awkward. People feel their favorite music is not unique enough, or they might not know enough about their favorite artist. Recognizing these challenges, we felt there must be innovations and improvements to the way music is accessed. We focused our attention on music streaming platforms, which is clearly the most popular and common way to access music. We felt that artist pages on these platforms play the most crucial role — they are central to the listener’s experience, serving as the bridges that connect artists with their audiences. Yet, these pages often fail to provide engaging, informative content that can improve the listener’s experience and knowledge. This realization led us to conceptualize a redesign of these artist pages, aiming to transform them into simpler, more effective interfaces that share exactly what the artist’s would want the listeners to know.

There are many streaming platforms out today. Some of them are better than others, but none succeed in the goals we have. We will focus on 3 main music streaming interfaces: Spotify, SoundCloud, and Apple Music. We feel these are our 3 strongest competitors on the market. First of all, Spotify is the most popular streaming platform with 602 million users as of April 2024. We feel spotify has a very strong UI design. Their website effectively uses a deep black background with a neon green tint for its interactive elements. However, their information is cluttered and confusing. The most egregious part of their design is the popular songs. This is the first thing presented when looking at an artist, so it is troubling it is so flawed. First of all the songs are not ordered by most popular. They are ordered by Spotify’s algorithm as to what might be most relevant at the time. This is confusing to users as some songs appear more listened to then they actually are. As well, this list is limited to 10 and cannot be expanded. So if you were looking for an extensive list of popular songs you are limited to what spotify thinks will be your favorite. Down from there the dashboard only gets more cluttered. The following sections have no logic to the order, confusing what is actually from the artist and what is generated by spotify. Overall spotify UI design is great, but their dashboard is extremely cluttered and has no rhyme or reason. Next, Apple music is the second most popular streaming service with 88 million users as of June 2022. Their platform is a step up from Spotifys, but still not reaching goals. Their website has a sharp UI design, with a strong white background with a bright red for interactive effects. This is not as easy on the eye as spotify, but it effectively highlights possible interactions. Their top songs are much better. They are listed clearly and are able to be expanded upon to view a full list of popular songs. However, their songs are also not ordered by actual listens and are again ordered by relevance. This poses the same problem as presented in Spotify. From here, the dashboard loses its effectiveness. The rest of the information is posed in square clickables blocks like an album, confusing where sections are changing. As well they are repeating sections. There is an essential albums list, immediately followed by an albums list. This is unnecessary as three out of the 4 top albums are usually displayed right away again in the next section. As well they have a more to hear and a more to see section following each other with similar songs as well. Overall, they are displaying effective information in an ineffective format. Finally our last competitor is SoundCloud. They are not as popular as the two earlier platforms. However, we feel SoundCloud is our strongest competitor in terms of Artist dashboard design. Their UI design is very similar to apple music with a strong white background and orange elements strongly popping out. They effectively display each section of the artist’s music at the top of the page, making it clear to decipher which page you are on. As well, they successfully display popular songs by listening to them, so users clearly understand which are the most popular songs. Also relevant information like social media and tour dates are displayed on the side of each page. However, their dashboard is a bit cluttered as well. They display a bar graph design showing the escalated moments of the song, which is really informative to look at individually, although when displayed with each song and each album, it becomes extremely distracting. As well other elements are very large like album cover and play buttons, which hides the song title away. Overall, SoundCloud is an extremely effective dashboard that still remains cluttered.

Our objective focuses on displaying a simpler, yet deeper analysis of music, examining both broad and specific musical elements. We will remove unnecessary clutter like randomly created playlists, unnecessary sections of music aspects, and oversizing of small aspects of an Artist’s music. In the deeper analysis scale, we look at genre, sub-genre, mood, era, instrumentation, and performance/production style. More specifically, we analyze beats per minute (BPM), key, loudness, danceability, valence, the ratio of instrument to speech, and time signature. Citing an EY article on evolving fan experiences, it’s clear that “Robust customer data and analytics can help music companies deliver content and engage fans in meaningful ways through the channels they prefer.” Our dashboard is designed to do exactly that, offering fans a deeper understanding of their favorite artists and their music. Our dashboard will not only spotlight the technical facets of an artist’s music but also allow fans to see music through a new lens, potentially changing how they engage with it. This approach aligns a user’s personal playlist with new, relevant tracks and provides a view of musical intricacies they prefer. Additionally, our platform benefits artists and production companies by highlighting their latest and most popular music, and by displaying essential information such as social media links and concert dates to foster deeper connections with their audience. As noted by the Music Business blog, “connections are crucial not just for well-known artists but also for emerging talents aiming to expand their fanbase.” Our platform ensures that every artist, regardless of their popularity, is accessible to users with a Sonic account. To complement our technological solutions, we are also developing a style guide for our company’s brand. This guide will display the branding of the company including logos, colors, and fonts. Moreover, we are crafting a low-fidelity prototype of our app. This prototype will not only serve as a visual mock-up of our application but also as a tool to refine user interface and experience before development begins. These steps are crucial as they help in visualizing the potential impact of our solution and in laying a solid foundation for the detailed design and development phase.

Creating a style guide is an effective way to draw up initial designs. Following a template was extremely helpful in creating the branding for our company. Our first step in creating the style guide was analyzing colors. We loved a beige, off-white color to begin with. We found that this would be an effective calming background similar to Spotfy’s deep black. From here we looked at colors that popped well off the beige color, but did not want them to be too bright. This is where we found the purple and the orange color. From there, we needed background colors, which were selected through research of pairing colors. The fonts were quite difficult to find. We looked for bold fonts for a title to build off. That is where we found Optima. Optima has an Extra Black font which is a great bolding for titles with sharp edging. From there we looked to pair it with a similar font of thinner letters. That is where we found Helvetica Neue. After establishing those Creating logos was quite simple. For the icon logos, we drew inspiration from sports teams with the hooked letters. The main logos were just simple deployments of the fonts and colors, which follows the same ideals as the product, simple and concise. In terms of layout, these design features were used in different parts of the prototype. The pages follow soundclouds design where each page is listed on top where you can clearly see which section you are in. From here the song pages and album pages are simply displayed, only paired with views and the album cover. This is similar for albums with only the album cover and name. When you clicked on a song, you were taken to a detailed view with lyrics, a song analysis, and information about the singer. The colors and fonts used to show this information were carefully chosen. This page also had pictures of things like BPM, key, and mood. The main color palette was used to show the different parts of music in an easy-to-understand and interesting way. The album and artist pages were both designed in a similar way, with a focus on visual order to draw attention to the most important details. Background colors slightly separate different parts of the content, making it easy for users to find their way around huge music libraries without getting too overwhelmed. Overall, using our style guide in the prototype wasn’t just about making sure everything looked the same; it was also about making the user experience unified and interesting, just like our brand identity is clear and easy to find. This careful approach made sure that every part of the prototype, from the fonts and colors to the layout and the way it interacted with users, worked together to make finding and enjoying music easier and more fun.

To create the artist dashboard in python, we began by extracting data from Spotify using their API as well as the spotipy library. Conveniently enough, it was an API that we had all used before and so the reasoning behind it was simply the fact that we were familiar with the functionality. From this point, we created a “getartistinfo” function which was essentially the baseline of all the information we pulled. This function included the information that can be found in the tabs within the dashboard such as general information, top tracks, albums, and similar artists.

In order to put these functions into the interactive dashboard, we used a library called IPython widgets. A big problem that we initially ran into was finding a library that was directly connected to the jupyter notebook rather than within the terminal of your computer. Through some extensive research and testing multiple different libraries, we finally found one that suited our needs as well as had easy functionality. The tabs aspect of IPython widgets was extremely helpful and relevant to our dashboard considering we wanted it to be a much simpler design. Rather than having to scroll through an entire artists’ page, you were able to see all available information by simply clicking on one of the tabs.

After finalizing the tabs we wanted, it was time to figure out how we wanted to approach adding in the audio analysis to the top tracks. Initially, our plan was to use graphs of audio analysis that would display next to the songs whenever you clicked on them, however, implementing these graphs was a multi-step process that would consistently get tons of errors. Thankfully, the spotipy library has a step before this point where you can pull the audio analysis and it will return a table of information such as tempo, key, danceability, and many others. From this point, it was a matter of how we were going to implement this into our dashboard, which is when we found out that you can create a function in Ipython widgets, where once a button is clicked (in this case one of the top tracks), you can display information. Through testing different layouts of how it was going to be displayed, we figured out ditching the initial table and having them displayed as such-Danceability: 0.983, Tempo:122.36, etc.- was the most simple, concise way of displaying our information. To dive even further into the analysis of each song, we decided to implement the Genius API further on into our process. The benefits that come with this is the fact that you can do a sentiment analysis of the lyrics in the song, giving you information on the mood of the song, as well as a graphical representation of which words were used most in the song. We thought this added a super unique aspect to the dashboard and allowed users to understand and analyze songs in a way they may have never even realized.

The final system we worked on was the create a playlist function, which is the final tab on our dashboard. In a perfect world, you would be able to put in your spotify ID, and it will give you songs based on similar artists, song type, and the audio analysis that you can upload from our dashboard straight into your spotify account. Our thought process behind this was you can create playlists based on these variables, and it will create a playlist that matches up with them, as nobody wants a playlist where one song is super high tempo, with a very positive mood score, and the next is a low tempo, sad song about a breakup. However, in this area there were definitely some limitations due to how the Spotify API functions which we will dive more into in the next paragraph.

As said previously, there were limitations that we ran into throughout the process of creating our dashboard, and a large one was the create a playlist function. Since everything is localized, and to access the Spotify API you need to create your own “application” within the Spotify dashboard, it comes with a specific key that makes it so only you or someone with your key can access it. In similar fashion, there is also a redirect uri which is “the location where the authorization server sends the user once the app has been successfully authorized and granted an authorization code or access token.”, and this part was very finicky as it would work for one run of the code, but not for the next. Also, it was specified for the same key and client secret that you are using in the code, making it so only the person whose key is in the notebook can enter their user ID. Ideally, we would have made it so any person can input their spotify user ID and it would add a playlist based on their search directly into their Spotify account. Another limitation was the Spotify API and the spotipy library itself. Although the API and library were completely essential in the creation of our dashboard, it simply doesn’t provide everything that we would have liked to put in. In our figma prototype, we added in tour dates and social media for the artists, which is not a function in the API, and if we were to embed this information into an app/website, we likely would’ve needed to use several different API’s. Similarly, there are a limited number of calls that you can make in both the Spotify and Genius API, and there were times in the early development of the dashboard where we reached the limit and you had to wait an extended period of time to start searching for artists again. Obviously, this would be a huge limitation if our dreams of partnering with Spotify were to ever happen, as millions of people use Spotify every single day and having it time out would not be ideal. Finally, and probably the biggest limitation, time. If this was a project that we could work on for even a year, the possibilities that we could come up with and really hone in on every aspect that we wanted to are much more. However, this is something that is obviously out of our control. Overall, the majority of the limitations behind our project were within the API sector, and how in order to actually run the code, you need to create your own Spotify developer account and access your keys and client secrets. To transition the dashboard from a localized application to an accessible service, an alternative solution that does not rely on individual users supplying their own API keys and developer accounts would be required.

Our first deliverable was our artist dashboard, a comprehensive dashboard that integrates essential artist information, social media links, and tour dates. It allows users to access detailed data on their favorite songs and artists. We used IPython Widgets for interactive UI components, Spotify API for accessing music data, and Genius API for lyrics. The interface provides a more in-depth look at musical elements such as genre, BPM, and mood, enhancing user engagement with music streaming. Secondly, our Figma prototype, a low-fidelity prototype developed to visualize the user interface of the artist dashboard. This prototype is designed following the style guide created for the project. The purpose of this is to refine the user experience and interface design before development, ensuring that the dashboard is intuitive and visually appealing. Some of the features include simulated pages of song and album displays, detailed views with lyrics and song analysis, and a layout that prioritizes ease of navigation. Lastly, our style guide, a guide outlining the visual and branding elements of the dashboard, including logo, color scheme, and typography. The color includes a base of beige and off-white for backgrounds, with purple and orange for highlights and interactive elements.

Our group worked very well together and we split up the work into a way that we believed was the most effective and efficient given our skill sets entering the project. Nick was in charge of creating the stylistic aspects of our project. Both with the style guide and the figma prototype, Nick learned about creating style guides and how to use colors and fonts in order to make our dashboard look ideal, and extended this knowledge into our figma prototype, logos, and even our presentation for the class. JT created the baseline for the code and created the main function “getartistinfo” which helped kickstart the making of the dashboard considering it was how we extracted all the information from a search of a button. Also, he did the research behind the libraries, finding Ipython Widgets and creating the initial, and finalized format of the dashboard. JT also worked with the Spotify API to input the code of whenever the top track song was clicked on, it would display the audio analysis of the song. Zach also worked very closely with the code. Once the baseline code was in and we were able to extract the audio analysis from clicking on each song, Zach helped format this from a table into a much more simplistic, easy to read format. He also worked with the Genius API and was responsible for the creation of the sentiment analysis and passing it through the vader score, giving us information about the song’s mood and whether it was neutral, positive, or negative. Lastly, Zach created the chart that displayed each song’s top ten most popular words, which added another level of analysis that you don’t see in any other dashboards.

Based on the time we were given we learned a good amount about how streaming platforms operate and a lot about how to create a comprehensive artist dashboard that satisfies user needs. By utilizing Ipython Widgets, Spotify API, Genius API, and Figma we were able to create an artist dashboard that allows the user to gain access to more information on their favorite songs and artists, links to social media accounts, and tour dates. If we had more time to work on this project we would have created a more usable dashboard that was implemented into a website to create a real user experience. Another thing we would have liked to do would be to find a way to use the audio features to create playlists, or to have a feature that allows you to create a playlist based on your favorite artists and songs that you input. We would have also liked to find a way to implement social media tags to the dashboard that you could find the artist on Instagram, Twitter, etc. We would have also liked to interview some real artists and get a better understanding of what artists are looking at when creating their online profiles. A remaining question we have on this project is, is it possible to create this app on our own? Thinking about it, we truly are controlled by whatever Spotify and Apple Music put out because they have all of the data. We believe the next step for this project would be to continue working and try to pitch this idea to a top streaming platform.
